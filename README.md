These files are my Emacs configuration. There's a mixture of my own personal Lisp and packages I've downloaded from the
web.

I'm using Emacs 24.3.

This repository is meant to be in the Emacs site-lisp directory. I like all of my Emacs files to be in one place
(e.g. c:\emacs) so I don't use a .emacs or .emacs.d. Instead, I put everything in site-lisp, and have a site-start.el
that runs config code.

To set this up, download Emacs, cd into its site-lisp directory, and clone the repo:
  cd c:\emacs\site-lisp
  git clone https://github.com/nosferalatu/emacs-config.git .
