These files are my Emacs configuration. There's a mixture of my own personal Lisp and packages I've downloaded from the
web.

I'm using Emacs 24.3.

This repository is meant to be in the Emacs site-lisp directory. I don't use a .emacs or .emacs.d because I prefer
all files related to Emacs to sit in one directory (e.g. c:\emacs). To do this, I put everything in site-lisp, and have
a site-start.el that runs config code.
