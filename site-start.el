;; This file is the entry point for my Emacs lisp. It is loaded before .emacs.
;; I like all of my Emacs files to be located in the same directory as Emacs,
;; so I put everything in c:/emacs/site-lisp instead of using .emacs or .emacs.d.
;; This way, Emacs is self-contained, and easily copied from one machine to another
;; (just copy all of c:/emacs/*).
